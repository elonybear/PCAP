# PCAP Database Website
This website is used by the University of Michigan Prisoner Creative Arts Project organization.

### Basics
The website allows users to search the PCAP database for art pieces produced by prisoners.

All art pieces shown are those from artists that have not yet received critiques. 

Once all artists have received a critique, the user will be able to peruse pieces that have not received individual critiques.
